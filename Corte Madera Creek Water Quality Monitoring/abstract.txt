Abstract:
Friends has been monitoring E. coli in fresh water reaches and Enterococcus in tidally influenced reaches of Corte Madera Creek and its tributaries since 2003.  During two sampling events over two separate summer field seasons, E. coli and Enteroccocus concentrations in Corte Madera Creek and its tributaries exceeded EPA criteria for bathing in all sites except those far upstream (at the headwaters) and downstream (at the mouth).  Possible sources of this contamination include leaky sewer pipes, and non-human sources such as dogs and water fowl.   This continued sampling effort focuses on isolating the source of this contamination, and to the extent possible, determining the source of the contamination.  We  use this information to educate students, community groups and individual homeowners and engage their participation in developing efforts to improve water quality.
