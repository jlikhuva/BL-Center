Abstract:
Contra Costa RCD has been working with Partners for the Watershed, a group of local educators, government and industry, since 2002 to involve the community and local students in restoration and stewardship projects in the Kirker Creek Watershed. On behalf of the Partners, the RCD requests funding to create additional opportunities for student and volunteer participation in local watershed activities. Funding will provide for volunteers to propagate native plants at a City of Pittsburg-owned site for planting at their schools, in City landscaping, and at a local wetland restoration site. The City of Pittsburg is providing office and greenhouse space for a watershed nursery program; Dow Chemical is providing the restoration site, propagation and restoration supplies and the support of their volunteer restoration team, and UC Berkeley is providing educational instruction and some supplies. The Partners request funding for staff who will: 1) coordinate plant propagation activities at the nursery; 2) lead planting and restoration activities; and for services and supplies to support these activities. The CCRCD will work with hired staff, local schools and project partners to implement the program.
