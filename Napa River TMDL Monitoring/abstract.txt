Abstract:
The proposed project will establish a monitoring program to assess salmonid populations and instream sediment levels in the Napa River basin. The project directly addresses the recommendations of the Draft Napa River Sediment TMDL to collect current, statistically valid data on steelhead and salmon populations and the related impacts of sediment pollution. The proposed program will provide critical information to state and federal agencies, which will be needed for guiding adaptive updates to the sediment TMDL implementation plan. There has been a long-term decline in salmon and steelhead populations in the Napa River basin, but very little quantitative information has been or is being collected to assess this trend. A few pilot studies have been conducted to examine the relationship of sediment pollution and fisheries declines, but more extensive efforts are needed.
