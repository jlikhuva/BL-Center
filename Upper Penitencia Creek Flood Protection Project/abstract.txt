Abstract:
The purpose of this project is to improve Upper Penitencia Creek to ensure flood protection from a 100-year flood event.  The project limits extend approximately 4.2 miles between the confluence with Coyote Creek and Dorel Drive.  Upper Penitencia Creek is a tributary to the Coyote Creek system, and its watershed is approximately 24 square miles in size.  The Santa Clara Valley Water District is working in partnership with the United States Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) to prepare a planning study (Feasibility Study) and an Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report (EIS/EIR).  The project team is coordinating with the City of San Jose on future development projects and their Trails Master Plan; the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority on the BART project; and resource agencies (National Marine Fisheries Service, Regional Water Quality Control Board, California Department of Fish and Game, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and Environmental Protection Agency).
