Abstract:
The Colma Creek Flood Control Channel provides flood protection for residents of South San Francisco, Colma and Daly City. Loss of salt marsh wetland habitat caused by flood control channel improvements are being mitigated by restroring 1.5 acres of salt marsh wetlands and 2.0 acres of high-quality upland habitat located at the outlet of Colma Creek to San Francisco Bay. Funding is sought to complete three projects on the Colma Creek Flood Control Channel. One project would install a sheetpile wall on the south side of the Colma Creek Channel from Utah Avenue to Navigable Slough to provide enhanced flood protection at the lower reaches of the Channel. A second project would provide for continued maintenance and monitoring at the habitat mitigation site located along the creek banks near San Francisco Bay. A third project would develop and implement a trash managment program aimed at reducing the amount of trash entering the flood control channel from adjacent and upstream communities.
