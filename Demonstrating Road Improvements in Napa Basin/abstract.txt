Abstract:
In 1990 the Water Board listed the Napa River for excess sedimentation. A draft TMDL for sedimentation was released in 1995, which identified roads as a significant source of sediment. Roads have been identified as a major sediment source in Carneros and Sulphur Creeks, tributaries to the Napa River. The proposed project is aimed at erosion control and sediment reduction to streams through the treatment of high and high-moderate treatment priority sites and hydrologically connected road reaches. Treatments include stream crossing culvert installations, fillslope stabilization and a variety of road surface treatments. By applying the proposed treatments, approximately 21,944 yds3 of sediment would be prevented from being delivered to streams. Direct benefits include: turbidity reduction, sediment delivery reduction, improved salmonid habitat, improved water quality, and progress toward meeting sediment reduction goals defined by the draft TMDL.
