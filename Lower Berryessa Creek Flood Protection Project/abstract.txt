Abstract:
The District is undertaking this project to plan, design, and construct a project that will provide protection from the 100-year flood event along Lower Berryessa Creek between the Lower Penitencia Creek confluence and Calaveras Boulevard in the Cit of Milpitas. Included in this project are improvements to the lower reaches of both Calera and Tularcitos Creeks.  These improvements are needed due to the backwater effect on these tributaries. The project includes coordination with the City of Milpitas Trails Master Plan, District maintenance requirements, and the Upper Berryessa Creek Project upstream of Calaveras Boulevard. The length of the project is approximately 2.9 miles. The creek is bordered by residential development on both sides, and traverses through the center of Milpitas in a highly developed area.  Major project deliverables include an Engineer's Report (ER); Environmental Impact Report (EIR); regulatory permits; and plans, specifications, and estimates (PS&E) on an alternative for improving the channel to accommodate the 100-year flood event safely.
