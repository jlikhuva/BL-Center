Abstract:
This project will stabilize and restore the Ledson Marsh dam, ensuring the survival of this important 30-acre marsh ecosystem and the wildlife that depend on it.  The dam is currently in a severely degraded state, and in desperate need of repair.  This project will correct the current erosion occurring from the dam as it deteriorates, and rebuild the dam so that it functions properly to sustain the hydrology of the seasonal wetland.  This project is critical for the survival of the population of California Red-legged Frogs that live in Ledson Marsh.
