Abstract:
Approximately 1.1 miles of severely degraded Table Rock Trail within Robert Louis Stevenson State Park will be re-routed (resulting in approximately 2 miles of reconstructed trail), while many existing trail sections will be repaired by the installation of trail drainage structures (i.e. drainage swales, rock armoring).  This trail restoration work is necessary to reduce the excessive erosion that is occurring, as water flows down the entrenched trail and delivers sediment to streams, interrupting hydrologic patterns and watershed function.
