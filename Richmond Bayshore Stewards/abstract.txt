Abstract:
The Watershed Project is working with UC Berkeley and other partners to restore West Stege Marsh and the adjacent upland prairie habitat, and to provide educational and community involvement opportunities related to the restoration. This project is located at the Richmond Field Station, a satellite campus of UC.  The 152-acre field station, on the San Francisco Bay in Richmond, includes approximately 72 acres of marsh and mudflat, and 23 acres of upland terrace prairie habitats. These habitats provide refuge for the federally endangered California clapper rail (Rallus longirostris obsoletus), various species of migratory water birds, and more than 62 native plant species. Due to industrial contamination, the University is currently engaged in remediation work within the marsh and coastal prairie at the RFS. The contaminated sediments are being removed in phases, and the Watershed Project is engaged in revegetation and invasive non-native plant control in the remediated areas and additional coastal prairie. Active restoration is underway for approximately 5 acres of Stege Marsh and 1 acre of adjacent wet meadow and coastal prairie. The project has a large educational and community outreach component, providing educational field trips and service learning opportunities for local students and adults.
