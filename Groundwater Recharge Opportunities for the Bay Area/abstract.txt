Abstract:
This project would investigate groundwater recharge opportunities throughout the Bay Area, including potential sites where small, shallow passive detention basins could be used to:  - Attenuate flood peaks.  - Reduce runoff volumes. - Recharge groundwater.The project would incorporate outreach to landowners and provide opportunities to combine flood control, groundwater recharge, open space preservation (by protecting recharge areas from development), habitat enhancement (through creation of seasonal wetlands and improved base flow in creeks) and recreational opportunities.
