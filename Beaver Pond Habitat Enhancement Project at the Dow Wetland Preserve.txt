Abstract:
The project is located at the Dow Wetland Preserve in the Kirker Creek Watershed in east Contra Costa County. The 475-acre Preserve provides important tidal and upland marsh habitat for over 120 species of birds, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals in an area dominated by industry. The goal of the Beaver Pond Habitat Enhancement Project at the Dow Wetland Preserve is to enhance a significant wildlife habitat in the lower Kirker Creek Watershed; improve water quality through increased infiltration; involve a diverse group of volunteers in field-based learning and restoration, and increase collaborative partnerships both regionally and within the watershed. The Beaver Pond Project involves planting 20,000 plugs of various native species along the western edge of the runoff- and groundwater-fed pond located on The Preserve.
