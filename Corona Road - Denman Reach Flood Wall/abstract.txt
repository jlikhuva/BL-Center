Abstract:
This project is located on the west bank of the Petaluma River, outside the city limits of Petaluma.  The project includes the installation of a 4-foot flood wall along approximately 1,500 feet of the Petaluma River’s west bank from the Corona Road bridge northwestward. This project is designed to retain the 8,000-cfs flow anticipated from a 100-year frequency storm with the Petaluma watershed developed to General Plan densities.
