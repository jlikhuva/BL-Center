Abstract:
The proposed project would increase the existing tidally influenced area from nine acres to over 20 acres, create two isolated bird nesting islands (including one designed specifically for special status species), provide nursery areas for fish and benthic organisms, transitional and upland areas to buffer sensitive habitats, more than 5,000 feet of new interpretative trails with five vista points, 2.5 acres of passive public use areas, an approximate 1,200 square foot multi-use interpretive center with restroom facilities, new access to the restored area, and additional amenities including parking, fencing, lighting, benches, and drinking water fountains.  The restoration design, which would include re-vegetation, would also address soil contaminant issues arising from previous fill activities that could affect human and wildlife health.  In early-2006, we expect to receive the final permits from the Army Corps of Engineers, the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board, and the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission approving the final project design.  Although the restoration of Yosemite Slough could occur in one phase over the course of 24 months, we have broken it down into three sections—the South Area, Northeast Area, and Northwest Area—that can be restored simultaneously or one-by-one in 12-24 month phases depending on the availability of funding.   Restoration efforts are planned to begin in the fall of 2006.
