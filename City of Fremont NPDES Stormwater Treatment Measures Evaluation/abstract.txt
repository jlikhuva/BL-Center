Abstract:
As of August 15, 2006, most new and redevelopment projects in the Bay Area that create or replace 10,000 square feet or more of impervious surfaces are required to consider site design strategies to maximize pervious surfaces within the development area and to incorporate stormwater treatment measures and source control measures into the project design.  Although many of the stormwater treatment measures advocated by the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board (Regional Board) have been installed and in use on the East Coast, the Northwest, and other parts of the world for some time now, relatively few have been installed and evaluated in the Bay Area to date.  Consequently, municipalities in the Bay Area are struggling with implementation of the new NPDES requirements. Specifically, knowledge of design and installation challenges is limited; operation and maintenance requirements are unquantified; and pollutant removal effectiveness in the semi-arid Bay Area is unknown.  The goal of this project is to study the installation, operation and maintenance requirements, and pollutant removal efficiencies of two commonly used stormwater treatment measures, bioswales and media filtration units, located along a major transit corridor in Fremont, CA.  The information collected for this project will help municipalities to establish budgets and staffing requirements to meet the new stormwater requirements, as well as establish pollutant removal efficiencies of the two treatment measures.
