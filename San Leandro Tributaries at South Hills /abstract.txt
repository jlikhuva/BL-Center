Abstract:
Project would lead to the permanent protection of 250 acres of undeveloped, privately held open space that is currently at risk of development.  The project area contains two first order tributaties connected to floodplain benches.  The two tribuataries are banded by approximately 80' of riparian vegetation which transitions into adjancent California bay forest habitat.  Preservation of the property would protect existing habitat and water quality values.  If acquisition of the entire 250 acres is not feasible due to funding availability, acquisition of the most senstive habitats will be pursued.  Moderate restoration activities, trail construction, and educational signage are proposed for Phase II.
