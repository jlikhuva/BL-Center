Abstract:
The project is located in the Petaluma River Basin within the lower Lynch sub-basin. A biotechnical bank stabilization structure will be installed to prevent further stream bank erosion that is threatening the parking lot and nature walk at Lucchesi Park. Additional removal of unstable trees and debris will be followed by revegetation with native trees along 1,320 feet of Lynch Creek adjacent to Lucchesi Park to Maria Drive and along an additional 1,980 feet of Lynch Creek from Maria Drive to Sonoma Mountain Parkway.Â
