Abstract:
Funding is sought to demonstrate and improve use of bio-engineering techniques on eroding sections of Pescadero Creek, Tunitas Creek, Purisima Creek, and Lobitos Creek, located in unincorporated San Mateo County. The target eroding creek banks are located adjacent to county-maintained roads and within county rights-of-way. These creeks are designated as critical habitat for steelhead trout by the National Marine Fisheries Service. Grant funds will be used to train engineering staff and road crews, design site-specific bioengineered projects, permitting, construction, and monitoring.
