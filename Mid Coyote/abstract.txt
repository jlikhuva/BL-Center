Abstract:
The Mid Coyote Project is located in the central portion of the Coyote Watershed. Its limits extend approximately 6.1 miles between Montague Expressway and I-280, all in the City of San Jose. The project's primary objective is to enhance the creek's conveyance . Additionally, the project will improve fisheries and habitat values and provide appropriate public access opportunities in cooperation with the City of San Jose. This multi-year study will necessitate preparation of a detailed Engineer's Report and an Environmental Impact Report to comply with CEQA.This project is part of the District’s Clean, Safe Creeks & Natural Flood Protection Program (Program).  In November 2000, the voters of Santa Clara County approved funding for the Program (Measure B) which includes planning, design, and partial construction of the Mid-Coyote Project.  The funding for this project will be provided exclusively from Program revenues through June 2016.  It should be emphasized that funding is included for only partial construction, the intent being that alternative funding sources will need to be identified to complete the project at the time a preferred project alternative is selected and design estimates are prepared.
