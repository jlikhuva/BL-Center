Abstract:
This project would do three things: (1) enlarge and level the collection swale at the bottom of the meadow to slow down the water and enhance sediment drop-out, as well as to provide additional capacity; (2) install three upstream trash racks to catch and divert debris onto the constructed floodplain and by doing so prevent future obstruction at the outlet structure;   (3) construct an interceptor channel to re-capture the bypassing flow and route it back to the meadow.
