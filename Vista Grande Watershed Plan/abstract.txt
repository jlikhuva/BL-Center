Abstract:
The Vista Grande Watershed Plan is being developed jointly by the City of Daly City and the City and County of San Francisco under its Public Utilities Commission as its lead agency. The plan intends to identify potential solutions to meet the goal of resolving flooding at the Vista Grande Canal and within the Vista Grande Drainage Basin for the 10-year storm event. The plan takes a watershed approach by involving stakeholders input into the planning process and developing objectives in examining both upstream and downstream alternatives.The study area includes approximately 2.5 square miles of the Vista Grande Watershed area in Daly City and unincorporated San Mateo County and the Vista Grande canal and tunnel located in San Francisco. The watershed borders San Francisco County on the north, Colma Creek Watershed to the south and east and the Pacific Ocean on the west. At issue is resolving a watershed basin that during a 10-year, 4-hour storm that generates a peak flow of 1,300 cfs that drains into a canal with 500 cfs and into a tunnel for discharge into the Pacific Ocean at 170 cfs. As a result the lack of conveyance capacity results in surcharging at the tunnel entrance flooding across John Muir Drive and because of system hydraulics upstream flooding in Daly City and unincorportated San Mateo County.The plan has identified four separate but linked improvement projects aimed at resolving flooding issues and maximizing area-wide benefits.The four projects are:* New storm drain tunnel* Creation of Vista Grande Wetlands* Upstream Storm Drain Improvements* Ongoing inplementation of Best Management Practices in compliance with Countywide NPDES   stormwater permit.
