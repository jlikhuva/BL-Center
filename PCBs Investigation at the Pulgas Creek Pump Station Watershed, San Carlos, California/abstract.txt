Abstract:
Bay Area-wide surveys of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in urban runoff sediments revealed relatively high concentrations in samples from the Pulgas Creek pump station in San Carlos.  Follow-up investigations confirmed the presence of PCBs and suggested multiple sources within the pump station's watershed.  Two possible sources have been identified, a DTSC cleanup site and a PG&E substation, but these sources have not been confirmed and other sources remain unidentified.  The goal of this project would be to develop methods to identify PCB sources in the watershed and take initial steps towards preventing discharge of PCBs from the pump station to San Francisco Bay.  Investigation efforts would include inspecting selected businesses and industrial facilities within the watershed to identify potential PCBs or PCB-containing sediments.  Inspection sites would be selected and prioritized based upon available records regarding potential of current or historic use of PCBs on-site.  Based on the results of the inspections, a targeted sampling and analysis program would be implemented to measure concentrations of PCBs in sediments found on private properties and in public right-of-ways.  STOPPP would then work with appropriate regulatory agencies to attempt to compel potential responsible parties identified during the investigation to perform further investigation and, as appropriate, abatement.  To prevent future releases of PCBs and sustain the results of the program, outreach and educational materials would be provided to business and property owners in the watershed.  Project methods, results, and any other relevant information would be made available on the San Mateo Countywide Stormwater Pollution Prevention Program's website.  In summary, this demonstration project would support abatement of sources of PCBs to San Francisco Bay and develop methods that would assist other agencies in the Bay Area and elsewhere to address PCBs in stormwater runoff.
