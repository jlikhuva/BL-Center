Abstract:
To address water quality impairment from nonpoint sources of copper, as identified in the San Francisco Bay RWQCB's Water Quality Attainment Strategy (WQAS), this regional project would investigate and implement options to reduce copper discharges in stormwater.  A WQAS for copper has been developed for the lower San Francisco Bay and the RWQCB is currently developing a similar WQAS for the rest of the Bay.  It was determined that the present concentration of copper in the environment, including loading rates, are currently below impairment thresholds.  Maintaining the water quality objectives for copper is regulated via updates to and enforcement of NPDES permit requirements.  Consequently, stormwater dischargers are responsible for managaging copper concentrations in the Bay.  Primary sources of copper discharges originate from deposition of air emissions, soil erosion, vehicle brake pads, architectural uses, and pesticide applications.  To control copper in stormwater discharges to the Bay, regional projects will study measures to manage washwater from cleaning and treatment of architectural copper, develop BMPs for use of copper-containing wood preservatives, develop control measures for pool, spa, and fountain algaecides, and restrict the use of aquatic pesticidies, including copper-containing algaecides.
