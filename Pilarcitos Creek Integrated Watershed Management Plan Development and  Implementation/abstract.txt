Abstract:
This project will develop and implement an Integrated Watershed Management Plan for the Pilarcitos Creek Watershed. Pilarcitos Creek is the principal watercourse draining a coastal watershed of 17,922 acres in San Mateo County, California. The land comprising the upper watershed of Pilarcitos Creek isowned by the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. Coastside County Water District owns thewatershed lands downstream of Stone Dam Reservoir and maintains an alluvial well field in this reach.Downstream of CCWD's property, land adjacent to the creek is owned by private and public entitiesincluding private parties, the City of Half Moon Bay, State Parks, and Sewer Authority Mid-Coastside.The development and implementation of a local IWMP would involve stakeholders through the Pilarcitos Creek Advisory Committee to determine how to more effectively manage the competing uses of water from Pilarcitos and promote balanced solutions that satisfy environmental, agricultural, public health and economic interests.
