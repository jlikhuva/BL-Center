Abstract:
This project will develop a community-based stormwater management plan for the Sunnydale Watershed, an urban watershed that falls under multiple jurisdictions, but whose stormwater and wastewater is treated by the SFPUC. This watershed contains significant industrial sites and brownfields, including a 750-acre site along the shoreline that is undergoing a redevelopment planning process in Brisbane as well as a smaller site in the San Francisco portion of the watershed that is undergoing a community-based planning process. Additionally, the stormwater flows from this watershed contribute to combined sewage overflows along the Bay.  This stormwater management program will develop a toolbox of low-impact development techniques that can be incorporated into both existing and new developments to improve watershed water quality and also act as part of a larger watershed restoration program that provides open space to the community.  In addition, local youth will be trained to help evaluate and test techniques after implementation.  Results and lessons learned can be used to apply to similar projects in other Bay area watersheds.
