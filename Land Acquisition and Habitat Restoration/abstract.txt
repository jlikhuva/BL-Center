Abstract:
Save Mount Diablo's mission is to preserve Mount Diablo's peaks, surrounding foothills and watersheds through land acquisition and preservation strategies designed to protect the mountain's natural beauty, biological diversity and historic and agricultural heritage; enhance our area's quality of life; and provide recreational opportunities consistent with protection of natural resources. Once we acquire property, we do clean-up, trail construction, planting, watering and habitat restoration, creek clean-ups, non-native plant removal, and other work projects. We've identified 80,000 acres of private lands for acquisition.
