Abstract:
The California Department of Water Resources proposes to implement the North Bay Aqueduct (NBA) Alternate Intake Project (NBA AIP) to improve water quality and reliability of State Water Project deliveries to its NBA contractors, the Solano County Water Agency and the Napa County Flood Control and Water Conservation District. The NBA AIP Â includes the construction and operation of a new intake and pumping plant on the Sacramento River, conveyance pipeline, and inline storage to divert and convey water from the Sacramento River connecting to the existing NBA pipeline near the North Bay Regional Water Treatment Plant in Fairfield.
