Abstract:
Funding is sought to develop and implement an urban trash management program for creeks and flood control channels. Reduction of trash in urban waterways provides for improved water quality, flood flow conveyance, ecosystem function, and aesthetics. The progam would be proactive in addressing potential TMDLs related to trash loading in creeks.  The program would focus on identifying and removing sources of trash as well as on conducting regular abatement activities. Community education components of the program would emphasize source reduction and develop an ethic of stewardship toward waterway function and health.  Effectiveness of program activities would be evaluated using the newly revised Urban Rapid Trash Assessment Protocol developed by the Santa Clara Valley Urban Runoff Pollution Prevention Program. See the Detailed Project Description for specific program elements.
