Abstract:
Repair eroded channel, stabilize banks and levees, remove sedimentation, improve catch basins and storm drain pipes in the Laguna Avenue residential area.  Improve channel conveyance capacity by increasing the size of the Terrace Creek box culvert from Laguna Avenue to California Drive, by installing a new pump station and force main in the vicinity of Carolan Avenue, and by installing  a debris basin upstream from Carolan Avenue.  Improve the benefits to the creek eco system.
