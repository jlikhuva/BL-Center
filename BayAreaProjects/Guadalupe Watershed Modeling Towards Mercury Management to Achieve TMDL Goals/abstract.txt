Abstract:
The purpose of the project is to compile extensive existing data and provide a comprehensive analysis of channel mercury (Hg) load response to various proposed management scenarios in order to determine the most cost effective method for achieving Guadalupe River TMDL Hg load reduction goals. If such modeling is not completed there is a greater risk that expenditure of public funds will not result in desirable load reductions or that expectations for a trend in the system in response to management may be unrealistic leading to disappointment and perhaps discontinuation of management activities that are in fact beneficial. This project will:1. Develop a comprehensive water quality model based on a calibrated and verified hydrologic model using the BASINS/HSPF (v. 3) modeling suite recommended by the EPA.2. Use this model to test combinations of feasible management scenarios to assist stakeholders in the prioritization of activities and the level of effort required to meet the 10 and 20 year load reduction targets. Specific questions include:Q1. What influence will the various management options (sediment dredging, channel modifications, reservoir management, hot-spot removal in tributaries and mining areas) have on concentrations and loads? Q2. What the differing influences on grainsize and quality are of suspended and bed sediment?Q3. How long will it take to see a trend and will this trend be sufficient to meet the proposed 10 year loading target (11 kg/y) and the 20 year loading target (7 kg/y)?3. Provide a completed watershed module ready for inclusion into future modeling of the south Bay salt pond restoration project areas (e.g. Pont A8). Note the proposed modeling component will not model processes in the tidal portions of Alviso Slough or within restoration ponds.
