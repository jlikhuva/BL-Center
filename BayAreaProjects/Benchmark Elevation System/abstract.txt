Abstract:
To improve the overall accuracy and reliability of the District's Benchmark Elevation, the District surveys and updates elevations on over 1,000 benchmarks in Santa Clara County.  The elevation information is available free of charge through the District's website in an interactive map-based or lookup program.  Providing this service ensures a standard and accurate datum for all water resources projects in the county.
