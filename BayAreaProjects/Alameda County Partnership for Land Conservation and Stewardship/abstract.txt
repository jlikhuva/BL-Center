Abstract:
This innovative program will facilitate and encourage preservation and enhancement of land resources across the County for agriculture, natural resources, wildlife habitat and open space, through easements, acquisition and other short and long term and permanent tools. Partners include landowners, non-profit organizations, government agencies and others. Beneficiaries will be the landowners, the public and a healthy working landscape which includes the protection and enhancement of watersheds and water quality. This is not a trust, but rather a facilitation service that matches and leverages existing programs, agencies, organizations and willing landowners. It will also attempt to develop innovative tools to accelerate voluntary land conservation and enhancement .
