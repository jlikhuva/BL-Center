Abstract:
The main elements of the project are to recontour, revegetate, and restore 1700' of the Rheem Creek channel and corridor that separates the City of Richmond's Highlands Community from the unincorporated county's Rollingwood Community.  The channel needs to be resized and graded to an appropriate slope to accommodate stormwater flows and transport sediment.  In addition to using simple soil bioengineering techniques to resist erosion and provide stability, the project will include planting 150 riparian trees to provide shady conditions to the creek to reduce instream vegetation and improve the wildlife habitat and aesthetics of the corridor.  This project is being carried out partnership with the Rollingwood Neighborhood Association and continues a partnership already in place.
