Abstract:
The Alhambra Valley Creek Coalition (AVCC) Restoration Project will stabilize severe erosion along a 1-mile reach of Alhambra Creek and at a headcut that threatens to undermine a dam in the upper watershed; enhance riparian habitat by replacing invasive plants with species native to the watershed; improve fish passage and in-stream habitat for native steelhead trout; restore two springs in the upper watershed, and reduce flooding by increasing channel capacity. Bank erosion along this reach is of particular concern because it threatens the gravesite of John Muir, located on National Park Service property. Further, residences on the entire reach are on septic systems; their leachfields are being exposed and are contributing to high bacterial levels in the creek. AVCC is the result of a coming-together of 47 neighbors interested in addressing their individual bank erosion concerns with a watershed approach. The innovation displayed by AVCC will be a leading example for creekside property owners across the state. Project location: Alhambra Creek from Alhambra Avenue to Alhambra Valley Road (1-mile); Stock Pond and two springs near Vaca Creek, a tributary of Alhambra Creek (on Sky Ranch, owned by Muir Heritage Land Trust)
