Abstract:
Bay Area flood control agencies have identified a potential initiative to accelerate the region-wide transition of flood control agencies from a primary focus on building and maintaining channels, levees, and infrastructure, to a more integrated approach including floodplain management, habitat protection and enhancement, and multi-objective capital projects. This transition would be accomplished by improving transfer of technical information and expertise, by facilitating completion of projects that can serve as exemplars, and by informing policy makers and the public. The initiative would establish a multidisciplinary regional team, composed of staff drawn from flood management agencies regionally, municipal staff, regulatory agency staff, local consultants and practitioners, and environmental advocates, to aid flood management agencies with conception, design, funding, and permitting of flood protection projects. In all cases, decision-making authority would remain with the agency sponsoring the flood protection project, with the interdisciplinary team in an advisory role. The team would assist more than one agency at a time, and would facilitate planning, design, and execution of flood-protection projects using the best available current expertise and ideas regarding watershed analysis, flood mapping and forecasting, floodplain management, urban planning, fish habitat enhancement, stream channel restoration, streambank stabilization, restoration of riparian vegetation, design of trails and recreational facilities, and water quality protection. Following implementation, the team would evaluate project construction or implementation and compare the results of the project to its objectives.The team would create a regular forum with expert presenters and discussions on issues of regional interest and timely relevance. This could be a means of kicking off a Regional Flood Forum and to engage local watershed/creek groups in discussions of strategies for the future of creeks and channels. The IRWMP Flood Protection/Stormwater Management Technical Coordinating Committee plans to begin this process by organizing a day-long session at the American Public Works Association Northern California Section meeting in November 2006.
