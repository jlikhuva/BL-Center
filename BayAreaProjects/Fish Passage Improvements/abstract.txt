Abstract:
A county-wide Fish Passage Assessment, conducted by Ross Taylor & Associates in 2004, identified 15 stream crossings in unincorporated San Mateo County that present fish passage barriers to high quality habitat. Funding is sought to treat these barriers according to guidelines in the California Department of Fish & Game California Salmonid Stream Habitat Restoration Manual. Treatment includes design, permitting, and construction.Design is well-underway for two of the high-priority barriers identified in the Taylor (2004) report: Alpine Creek and McGarvey Gulch. Permitting for these two projects is also underway.
