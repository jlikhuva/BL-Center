Abstract:
The Pond A8 Applied Study is a two-part study that will:  establish baseline information mercury in Pond A8 and Alviso Slough; craft appropriate management actions for Pond A8 (based on baseline information); modify management of Pond A8 to include tidal influence; monitor conditions after modification; and learn from management modifications.  Management modifications will be part of Phase I of the South Bay Salt Pond Restoration Project.  Lessons learned from this project have broad applicability throughout the Restoration Project area, both in Alviso and the Ravenswood and Eden Landing Pond systems.
