Abstract:
 In the fight to save salmonids, barriers to fish passage are an important issue. In Santa Clara County, over 350 sites have been investigated to evaluate fish passage in the San Francisquito Creek, Stevens Creek, Guadalupe River and Coyote Creek Watersheds.  About 20% of these sites need action to improve fish passage or should be monitored to observe whether the situation deteriorates.  Through a number of programs, the SCVWD is remediating many of the fish passage barriers that they own. But the fish passage barriers are owned by a broad range of agencies or owners, who may or may not have interest or resources to remediate them.  This project would identify barriers to fish passage in all of the county's streams known to support steelhead and evaluate which sites created the most serious impediments.  Based on the priority list, partnerships would be pursued to address the most serious fish passage issues no matter who owned them.  A system would be established to inspect the improved sites, pursue needed maintenance and evaluate which methodologies functioned best.
