Abstract:
The Watershed Monitoring and Assessment Program (WMAP) is a unique initiative among water agencies to efficiently and effectively use environmental data to inform planning and stream stewardship activities.  This multi-objective planning effort uses a watershed approach and an adaptive management framework that focuses on the district's priority environmental resource management interests within Santa Clara County.  The WMAP includes the establishment of the following 4 tiers:  (1) periodic reports on the status and trends of stream ecosystem health on a watershed basis in Santa Clara County; (2)an integrated environmental information management system to provide easy access to district data by district staff and the public; (3) an environmental data quality system to provide monitoring data of known and documented quality; and (4) a programmatic strategy that ensures the cost-effective collection and use of monitoring data.
