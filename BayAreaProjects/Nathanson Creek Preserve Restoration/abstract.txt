Abstract:
Nathanson Creek is perhaps the most prominent natural feature of the City of Sonoma, running through an unconfined channel in the project area on a designated preserve owned by the City and the Sonoma Valley Unified School District.  It provides habitat for threatened species including Steelhead trout and Chinook salmon, with salmon having been observed spawning just upstream of the project area for the last three years running. The creek receives a significant fraction of the City's stormwater, particularly from the rapidly urbanizing east side of town, and the adjacent school properties are frequently impacted by flooding on site. SEC has been administering a pilot education and restoration program on the Nathanson Creek Preserve for over four years with the support of the California Coastal Commission, the National Fish and Wildlife Federation, and CALFED.  SEC is now moving forward into implementation of the conceptual management plan for the Nathanson Creek Preserve with restoration of riparian vegetation communities (in progress) and planning and implementation of restorative channel modifications to expand the scope of weed eradication and revegetation, to help accommodate stormwater flows during peak flood events, to reduce rates of bank erosion, and to increase aquatic habitat quality and quantity.  Full build out will include installation of demonstation xeriscape gardens using native plants and interpretive facilities to educate the community about watershed connectivity and links between water conservation and the sustainability of riparian and aquatic ecosystems.
