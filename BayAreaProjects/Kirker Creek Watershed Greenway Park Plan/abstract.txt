Abstract:
The goal of the proposed project is to create a Greenway Park Plan for the Kirker Creek Watershed that balances human land uses with the preservation, enhancement, and restoration of natural resources. The plan will identify sites for restoration, recreation and interpretation with the goal of encouraging residents and other stakeholders to learn about, enjoy, and become involved in the enhancement of watershed natural resources.  Opportunities for projects with multiple benefits (including flood-control, water quality, and wildlife habitat, among others) will be identified, under the guidance of the Kirker Creek Watershed Management Plan, a community-based document that sets forth the community's vision for a healthy watershed. Descriptions and cost estimates for specific projects will be outlined in the plan, which will facilitate the receipt of grant funds. The Greenway Park Plan is also intended to serve as a valuable tool for local government and citizens in guiding future decision making and public correspondence. This document will be accessible to all interested residents and will be made available both in hard copy and digital formats.  This document will serve as a framework for continued conservation activity within the watershed as it faces continued pressure from growth. It will also serve as a model for neighboring watersheds to follow in the years to come.
