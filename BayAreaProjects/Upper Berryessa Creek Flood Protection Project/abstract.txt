Abstract:
The purpose of this Clean, Safe Creeks project is to improve Upper Berryessa Creek, and provide flood protection from a 100-year flood event along the creek between Calaveras Boulevard and Old Piedmont Road.  The length of the project is approximately 4.3 miles.  Upper Berryessa Creek is a tributary to the Coyote Creek system, and its watershed is approximately 22 square miles in size.  Prior studies found that homes along the creek are at risk to flooding and the creek experiences sediment deposition problems.  The District is working in partnership with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) to prepare a planning study (General Reevaluation Report), an Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report (EIS/EIR), and plans, specifications, and estimates (PS&E); and to construct the project.  The project team is coordinating with the cities of Milpitas and San Jose on future development projects and their Trails Master Plans; the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority on the BART project; and resource agencies (Regional Water Quality Control Board, California Department of Fish and Game, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and Environmental Protection Agency).
