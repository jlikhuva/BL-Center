Abstract:
Funding is sought to develop and deploy an education and assistance program for creekside landowners covering such topics as proper creek care, erosion prevention techniques, planting guide, pollution prevention, and suggestions for working as a community to address creekside issues. Assistance servicesÂ  include offerring general advice, referral to pre-approved private engineers, landscape architects and contractors, and permitting assistance. The proposed program also will offer information and activities directed at people who do not own creekside parcels.These might include elementary and school programs, and other community education activities. The pupose of these programs is to remind community members that their activities can affect creek health, even if the creek cannot be seen.
