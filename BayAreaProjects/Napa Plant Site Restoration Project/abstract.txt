Abstract:
The California Department of Fish and Game (DFG) is proposing a habitat restoration project atthe Napa Plant Site, a former salt production facility in the floodplain of the Napa River near theCity of American Canyon, California. The 1,460-acre project site was acquired by DFG fromCargill Salt Co. (Cargill) in March 2003, as part of the larger State of California, federal, andprivately sponsored purchase of 16,500 acres of salt ponds in the San Francisco Bay estuary. TheNapa Plant Site Restoration (NPSR) project (proposed project) would restore a mosaic ofwetland and associated habitats to benefit estuarine biota including waterfowl, shorebirds, fishes,and small mammals. It would re-establish wildlife corridors and connectivity of habitats at thelandscape scale. The proposed project includes establishment of public access to the site toprovide a variety of recreational and educational opportunities for the people of the region.
