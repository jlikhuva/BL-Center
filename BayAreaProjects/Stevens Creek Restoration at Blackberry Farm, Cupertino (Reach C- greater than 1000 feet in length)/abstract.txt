Abstract:
Remove fish barriers and restore riparian vegetation, improve over-wintering habitat to Stevens Creek near McClellan Road and Deep Cliff golf course.  Remove concrete hardscape to restore the creek to a geomorphically stable form and improve groundwater infiltration.This reach of Stevens Creek has incised over time.   To control erosion, concrete and gunnite have been poured onto the bank and river bed on the outside of bends, continuously over several hundred feet.  A number of concrete grade control steps have also been installed.  The grade controls and sections of concrete bed and bank have become a  barrier to fish passage on Stevens Creek.
