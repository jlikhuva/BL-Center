Abstract:
Construct multi-use flood control detention basins that allow continued use of detention basin land for agriculture to prevent flooding of adjacent land and Interstate 80.Â  Flooding in this area flooded Interstate 80 in 1997 and 2005. Solano County and City of Fairfield have an interest in preserving this land in open space. Obtain permanent easements on land to assure future agricultural use of land.
