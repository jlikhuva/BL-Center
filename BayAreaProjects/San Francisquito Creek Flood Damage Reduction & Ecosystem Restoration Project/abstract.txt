Abstract:
This is a joint project between the San Francisco District Army Corps of Engineers and SFC JPA to conduct a watershed wide Flood Damage Reduction and Ecosystem Restoration Project.  The project will address both creek and tidal flood prone areas, ultimately protecting over 10,000 parcels (business/homes) from the 1% or 100 year flood.  A General Investigation project has been authorized by Congress (2002); a Reconaissance Phase done resulting in positive finding of Federal Interest (2005); and the Feasibility Cost Share Agreement between Corps and JPA signed Nov 2005 ($7.5mill).  Feasibility Phase began December 2005, will be a 4 to 5 year process investigating alternative solutions, ending with a "community preferred plan".  Design & Construction Phases will follow.    The creek has historically flooded every 10years; the flood of record  in 1998 caused over $30mill in documented local damages.  The 45 sq mile watershed is home to several listed, threatened & endangered species including steelhead trout; has a dam at the center that is filled with sediment; and deposites into the SFBay in East Palo Alto.  The JPA represents 3 cities and 2 counties as a multi-jurisdictional cooperative effort, acting as the "local sponsor" to the federal project.
