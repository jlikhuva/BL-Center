Abstract:
The North Bay Aqueduct (NBA) is owned and operated by the Department of Water Resources and serves over 500,000 people in Napa and Solano counties.  Since inception the NBA has encountered substantial WQ and more recently, capacity concerns.  The NBA is in need of infrastructure and capacity improvements to increase capacity and minimize WQ impacts, to ensure a reliable water supply for Napa and Solano counties.  Specific infrastructure improvements consist of a Booster Station, installation of chemical facilities to reduce pipeline biofouling, as well as other needed improvements.
