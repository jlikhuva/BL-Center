Abstract:
This project will improve, upgrade and re-route approximately 2 miles of trail where severe environmental damage is occurring in the form of slope instability and massive landslides, accelerated erosion, creek sedimentation and deep trail down cutting. This work will serve both the purpose of providing sustainable and environmentally friendly trails along with enhancing public access in a prime natural area that experiences very heavy public visitation.
