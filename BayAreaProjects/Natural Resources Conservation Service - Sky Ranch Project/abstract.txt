Abstract:
The goals of the Sky Ranch Project are to stabilize severe erosion at a headcut that threatens to undermine a dam and restore two springs in order to reduce risk of erosion and enhance wildlife habitat on a 242-acre holding of the Muir Heritage Land Trust in the upper Alhambra Creek Watershed. The project will also increase understanding about watershed health and instill a sense of watershed stewardship by involving community volunteers and students in an on-the-ground restoration project.Project Location: Stock Pond and two springs near Vaca Creek, a tributary of Alhambra Creek (on Sky Ranch, owned by Muir Heritage Land Trust)
