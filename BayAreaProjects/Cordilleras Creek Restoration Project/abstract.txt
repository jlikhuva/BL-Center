Abstract:
The proposed project to undertake the removal a major modification in the stream channel and restore the existing degraded condition of the riparian corridor of a highly visible portion of Cordilleras Creek, a natural stream channel.  Activities for this project will include: removal of an existing vehicle bridge and footings spanning the creek channel; regrading portions of the channel banks; and recreating a functioning riparian corridor through removal of exotic species and bioengineering.  The existing vehicle bridge will be replaced by a clear spanning pedestrian bridge.  This project is intended to achieve public awareness of urban creek stewardship by implementing a demonstration project that includes stream/riparian protection and restoration that uses public participation, and provides public education.   The replacement bridge will provide access between the Redwood High School campus and the school’s native plant nursery (a former parking lot which was accessed by the existing bridge impacting Cordilleras Creek). Thus, the project is intended to instill ongoing stewardship of Cordilleras Creek through 1) support of a native propagation program on-site at the Redwood High School Student Nursery and student monitoring of its progress 2) education and outreach through workshops and community workdays for creekside residents and interested community members; and 3) signage on site describing the project purpose and objectives with information about the project sponsors/funders, and who to contact if they want to take part in Cordilleras Creek stewards program.
