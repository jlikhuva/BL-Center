Abstract:
The South San Francisco Bay Shoreline Study (Shoreline Study) is a Congressionally-authorized study being performed by the US Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) together with local sponsors, the Santa Clara Valley Water District (SCVWD) and the California State Coastal Conservancy (Conservancy), to identify and recommend for Federal funding one or more projects for flood damage reduction, ecosystem restoration and related purposes such as public access.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and other land-owning agencies within the project area will also be involved in the planning process.  The first of several “Interim Feasibility Studies” that will comprise the Shoreline Study will investigate flood protection for all OF Santa Clara County's and Southern Alameda County's Baylands, from Palo Alto to southern Fremont, in addition to the restoration of former salt production ponds within the Alviso Pond complex and adjacent properties such as areas around Moffett Field.
