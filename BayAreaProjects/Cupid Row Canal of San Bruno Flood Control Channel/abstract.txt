Abstract:
The Cupid Row Canal of the San Bruno Flood Control Channel protects residents in the City of San Bruno. The canal is at the lower reaches of Crystal Springs Creek, therefore it tends to collect upstream sediment deposits and trash. Cupid Row Flood Canal is inhabited by two Federal- and State-listed species: San Francisco garter snake and California red legged frog. Funding is sought to develop a watershed-level plan to reduce deposits of sediment and trash into the Cupid Row Canal. Funding also is sought to remove excess sediment from Cupid Row Canal and to construct a sedimentation basin nearby to reduce future sediment dischage into the Canal. Funding is also required to develop a long-term maintenance and vegetation management plan and obtain long-term maintenance permits.
