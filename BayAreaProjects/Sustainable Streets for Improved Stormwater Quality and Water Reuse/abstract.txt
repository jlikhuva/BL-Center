Abstract:
This project includes the initiation of a sustainable streets program by constructing stormwater treatment and reuse demonstration projects and preparing a stormwater design standards guidebook for municipalities to use in planning new and revitalizing existing urban streets to achieve multiple water quantity and quality benefits. Aside from water quality and quantity improvements, sustainable streets achieve multiple other community goals, such as encouraging transit oriented development, making urban areas pedistrian friendly, providing bicycle lanes, being visually attractive, and improving public health and safety. The sustainable streets aspect of the demonstration projects would assist municipal stormwater programs in the San Francisco Bay area and elsewhere around the state, and the stormwater design standards guidebook would be available on the Bay Area Stormwater Management Agencies Association's website for users statewide.
