Abstract:
This project will restore approximately two miles of extremely steep, degraded fire road where severe environmental damage is occurring in the form of accelerated erosion, creek sedimentation and deep down cutting, and replace it with a properly designed trail. This work will serve both the purpose of providing sustainable, environmentally-friendly trails, along with enhancing public access in a prime natural area that experiences very heavy public visitation.  The main project partner, The Sonoma Ecology Center will deliver pre-treatment sedimentation evaluation and monitor project improvements through water-quality assessment, photomonitoring, and geomorphic evaluation.  State Parks will conduct and oversee much of the actual construction with cooperation and assistance from the Sonoma County Trails Council and the Bay Area Ridge Trail Council.
