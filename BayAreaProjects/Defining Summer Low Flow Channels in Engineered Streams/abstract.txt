Abstract:
The overall goal of this project is to reduce sediment delivery and facilitate sediment movement in engineered stream reaches to be determined by this project.  Possible candidates that have active watershed-based approaches and are familiar to IRWMP are Corte Madera Creek, Lagunitas Creek, Guadalupe River and Alameda Creek.  Sediment management will be accomplished by improving and / or removing flood control structures, and stabilizing stream banks and creating / restoring thalwegs. These multiple efforts will improve summer habitat for the nationally threatened steelhead.
