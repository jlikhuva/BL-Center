Abstract:
This project will restore the natural riparian corridor of Mitchell Creek in Mount Diablo State Park (MDSP).  Mitchell Creek is one of the only perennial streams in MDSP, and is a tributary to Mt. Diablo Creek, which eventually flows to Suisun Bay.  Riparian restoration will include the removal of barriers to restore fish passage, improvements to channel stability, removal of fill from an old earthen dam and old roads along the creek bank, and re-countouring of the bank in some locations to help riparian vegetation become re-established.  Fish passage barriers include two cement dams, and two culverts.
