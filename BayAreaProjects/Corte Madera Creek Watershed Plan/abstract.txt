Abstract:
Friends of Corte Madera Creek Watershed is requesting funding to complete the Corte Madera Creek Watershed Plan, supported by a watershed assessment. We would complete the plan using a community-based approach, and would use the planning process to build on community support already present, expand the participation of stakeholders, and educate stakeholders, with the ultimate goal of having the watershed plan adopted by Marin County and the incorporated communities within the watershed. A draft plan has been developed that is consistent with the Marin County Planning Departmentâ€™s draft framework (MCCDA 2004). As part of the planning process, we have already identified a need for a comprehensive watershed assessment. The assessment will be conducted using the California Watershed Assessment Manual as a guide. Hydrology/geomorphology and fisheries assesments have been conducted; we need additional information about plant communities, non-native invasive species, special status species, water quality, and land use planning. Developing and completing a comprehensive watershed plan will provide an open forum for community-driven involvement, with the final product providing an organized framework, with clear descriptions of the watershed vision, priorities, responsible parties, and costs. This will increase our capacity for obtaining funding and implementing projects identified through the planning process.
