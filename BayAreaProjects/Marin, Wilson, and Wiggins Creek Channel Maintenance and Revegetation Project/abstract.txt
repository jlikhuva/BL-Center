Abstract:
This project will take place in the Petaluma River Basin within the Marin Creek sub-basin. The project site is located along Marin, Wilson, and Wiggins Creeks between Skillman Lane and Rainesville Road.  The project consists of sediment removal from the active channel.  In locations where sediment deposition is more severe the channel will be re-established.  Native trees and shrubs will be planted to stabilize the creek banks.
