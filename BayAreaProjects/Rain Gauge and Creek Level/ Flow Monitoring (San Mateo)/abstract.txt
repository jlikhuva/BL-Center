Abstract:
Funding is sought to install or repair existing rain gauges; install creek flow monitors; install web-cams at key locations to aid in emergency response, and provide a method to electronically record and distribute gathered information. Priority sites for recommissioned gauges will be at locations where long-term gauges have been removed over the last 20 years,Â  including La Honda, Pescadero, Princeton, El Granada, and Scarper's Peak. New gauges will be installed at locations where historic coverage is sparse. Locations that would benefit from additional coverage include Half Moon Bay area, southern San Mateo coastside hills (near Butano Park), and eastside hills above San Carlos. Exact locations for placement of new gauges and web-cams require further study.
