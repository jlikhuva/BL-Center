Abstract:
The project includes approximately 600 linear feet along Capri Creek in the Petaluma River Basin. The project consists of the selective removal of debris and vegetation in the active channel and includes non-native tree removal in the upland area along private property on the north side of the channel.Â  Native trees and shrubs are to be planted along the creek, improving riparian habitat and stream bank protection.
