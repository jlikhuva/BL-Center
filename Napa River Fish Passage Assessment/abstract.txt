Abstract:
This project aims to assess fish passage conditions in five key tributary watersheds of the Napa River basin, which have been identified as significant spawning and rearing streams for steelhead trout and chinook salmon. The project will fully assess an additional 10-15 known fish passage barriers identified from previous habitat surveys. The project is designed to provide a basis for establishing priority rankings for the removal and/or remediation of human made structures that impede passage and provide site-specific recommended treatments, which could be directly implemented. Very little is currently known about the extent or severity of passage barriers within the Napa River basin.
