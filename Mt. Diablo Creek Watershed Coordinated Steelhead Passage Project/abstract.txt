Abstract:
Until the 1980s, the Mt. Diablo Creek watershed supported a steelhead trout population. In the 1980s, earth moving related to subterranean pipelines near the mouth of Mt. Diablo Creek at Suisun Bay blocked access to the entire watershed. A debris gate in the middle watershed, modified in 2002, may block passage at some flows. For the past 70 years, steelhead access has been denied to pristine habitat in the upper reaches of Mitchell Creek (a main tributary) by two dams and a culvert. This proposal seeks funding to plan, design, and implement the necessary fish passage projects through out the watershed to restore steelhead access to 15 miles of stream habitat. An existing watershed inventory identifies removal of these barriers as critical to steelhead repopulation. The watershed assessment produced in coordination with the stakeholder-driven planning process identifies the potential for restoring steelhead to the watershed and called for detailed studies to restore passage.
