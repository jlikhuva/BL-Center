Abstract:
Thompson Creek Restoration Project would restore riparian habitat, stabilize the channel, and provide erosion protection along approximately 1.2 miles of creek. Project will lead to improved water quality and more diverse stream channel habitats in Thompson Creek. Project limits begin at Quimby Road and extend upstream to Aborn Road. Project is being studied under the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) Section 206 Aquatic Ecosystem Restoration Program.
