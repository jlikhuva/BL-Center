Abstract:
To address water quality impairment from nonpoint sources of PCBs, as identified in the San Francisco Bay RWQCB's PCB TMDL, this regional project would investigate options to reduce PCB loading in stormwater in anticipation of the forthcoming TMDL implementation plan and associated NPDES permit requirements.  Five major groups of projects would be implemented region-wide by municipal stormwater programs to address implementation of the PCB TMDL.  These include Pollution Prevention/Source Control BMPs; Soil/Sediment Control BMPs; Stormwater Treatment BMPs; Programmatic Activities; and Monitoring Activities.  BMPs to address and control PCB sources would be studied or implemented at pilot or larger scale by BASMAA municipalities.
