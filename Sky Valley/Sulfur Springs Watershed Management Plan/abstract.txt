Abstract:
The City of Benicia seeks assistance in designing an outreach approach to ensure citizen participation in the development of a Watershed Management Plan.  Meeting facilitation expertise will be a valuable component in this effort.  The City also seeks assistance in identifying issues and areas of interest to be addressed in the plan and in the establishment of project goals and objections.  The outcome of any assistance would be a project work plan for the development of a watershed management plan.
