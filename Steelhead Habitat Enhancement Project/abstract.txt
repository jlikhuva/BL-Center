Abstract:
The Project modifies three of Stanford's water diversion facilities: Los Trancos Creek Diversion Facility and Fish Ladder, San Francisquito Creek Pump Station, and Felt Reservoir. The modifications will provide more bypass flow during low creek flow periods, enhancing steelhead passage and habitat conditions. The modifications will enable Stanford to divert water more efficiently during high creek flow periods, thus preserving this important water supply. In addition, the facilities' fish screens and the fish ladder at the Los Trancos diversion facility will be modernized, providing better steelhead protection and enhanced steelhead passage conditions over a broader range of creek flow conditions. The Felt Reservoir portion of the Project consists of restoring its storage capacity in order to store the winter high flow periods' diversions reducing the need for spring low flow period diversions when steelhead may be sensitive to creek flows. Wetlands impacts from the Project are being mitigated in a newly created wetlands area adjacent to San Francisquito Creek.
