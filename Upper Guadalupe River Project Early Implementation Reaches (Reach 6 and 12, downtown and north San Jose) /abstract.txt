Abstract:
These early implementation reaches of the Upper Guadalupe River Project will provide 1-percent flood protection, reduce bank erosion and sediment-related impacts, provide/improve long-term riparian habitat improvements, and improve water supply reliability by combining flood protection elements with groundwater percolation and storage elements along the upper Guadalupe River.Â  Early implementation reaches include construction on Reach 6 - between Interstate 280 and Union Pacific Railroad bridge crossing near Willow Street in the quaint Willow Glen district and Reach 12 - between Branham Lane and Blossom Hill Road.
