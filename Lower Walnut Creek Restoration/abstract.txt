Abstract:
The Lower Walnut Creek Project incorporates a new way of approaching the traditional methods of operating and maintaining a flood control facility.  The existing channel is a classic Army Corps of Engineers trapezoidal earth channel that requires ongoing de-silting maintenance.   The alternative approach will be to move the channel levees back in the lower reaches to provide additional capacity for floodwaters and to create floodplains.  This approach will provide the necessary capacity to handle floodwaters while reducing de-silting costs and creating additional wetlands, riparian habitat and revegetation potential.  Other project components include improving fish passage and habitat and increasing recreational opportunities.
