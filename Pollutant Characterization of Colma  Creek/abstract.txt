Abstract:
For the past 10 years,  the City of South San Francisco has collected samples of Colma Creek at eight consistent sampling points, once per week.  The sampling points begin at the entrance of Colma Creek  into the city's northwestern limit, and follow along the creek to it's exit into San Francisco Bay at the Water Quality Control Plant. Included in the sample points are two background samples taken at the Oyster Point Marina and the windsurfing ramp at Oyster Point.These samples are analyzed for fecal coliform and BOD only. The intent of the proposed project is to expand the pollutant characterization of Colma Creek weekly sampling to include Polynuclear Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), Chlorinated Hydocarbons, Volatile Organic Compounds and ten metals (cadmium, chromium, copper, nickel, lead, zinc arsenic, silver and selinium). Sampling events and data collection would take place bimonthly  for one year. In addition visual inspection and description of sample sites at creek locations would be noted .
