Abstract:
The Pinole Creek Restoration Project will modify the lower 1.5 miles of an existing single objective engineered earth flood control channel to increase flood conveyance capacity. It will also restore structure and function, enhance aquatic and riparian habitat. In addition the project will provide recreational trail access and landscaping and integrate the discharge of high quality (tertiary treated) wastewater to improve year round creek flows and provide landscape irrigation.
