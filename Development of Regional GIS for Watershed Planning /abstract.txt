Abstract:
This project bundles together several related regional projects to standardize and enhance digital information regionwide about creeks, creek facilities, floodplains and watersheds.  The increased information base and regional standards will support hydrologic modeling and data sharing between and within counties.  The major projects supported by this effort will be led by different agencies, but will be coordinated through centralized technical committees to ensure standard data management and collection, storage and analysis techniques.  The project components will include:(1) Convene a region-wide technical committee to ensure consistent data collection, management, disbursement, coding, presentation, techniques;(2) Compile a countywide, pilot Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for San Mateo County that is FEMA-compliant and hydrologically enforced using LiDAR data that was collected by the County of San Mateo and several coorperating partners in October 2005.  This will be developed in close coordination with the technical committee as a pilot project to ensure consistent application of data collection and management standards that can then be applied region-wide;(3) Create new GIS base layers including inventory and accurate locations of natural and engineered channels, urban stromdrains, levees, riparian corridors, groundwater basins, etc.;(4) Enhance existing GIS layers related to watershed planning, in particular the streams layer;(5) Develop internet facing infrastructure, databases, and applications to facilitate datasharing among municipalities and agencies within and across counties in the Bay Area.
