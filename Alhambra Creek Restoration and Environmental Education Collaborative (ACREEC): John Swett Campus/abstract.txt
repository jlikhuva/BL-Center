Abstract:
This project builds on the ACREEC (Alhambra Creek Restoration and Environmental Education Collaborative) groupâ€™s previous achievements by instituting a similar program at another school campus located within the Martinez Unified School District that is in need of restoration, John Swett Elementary School.
The reach of Alhambra Creek at the John Swett Elementary School site is fed by a swale that runs the length of the campus along its North end. The swale is approximately 15 feet across, 3 feet in depth and approximately 400 lineal feet. The swale represents a significant area of potential riparian habitat, which is currently void of biological diversity due to urbanization. By turning this drainage into a vegetated swale, we will trap particulate pollutants originating from urban storm water runoff, thereby minimizing the amount of sediment being sent downstream by reducing erosion. Furthermore, by increasing infiltration, we will be minimizing the negative impacts that urbanization can have on the local hydrograph. This project can serve as a demonstration project for the entire watershed, educating others on the benefits of storm water Best Management Practices (BMP).
We propose to re-create this drainage into a vegetated swale that will serve as an outdoor classroom for the elementary school. Along the length of this vegetated swale, we will build a trail, complete with outdoor child and adult benches, and native riparian plants. This trail will connect the proposed project in order to facilitate the environmental education opportunities. Implementing this project, we will be demonstrating an innovative approach to urban storm water runoff for the community.
