Abstract:
The Solano Project was constructed by the US Bureau of Reclamation in the 1950s and is comprised of Monticello Dam, Putah Diversion Dam, Putah South Canal, and Terminal Reservoir.  Today, the project provides irrigation and municipal water to over 400,000 people in Solano County.  However, the Solano Project is 60 years old and is in need of upgrades, repairs, and modernization.
