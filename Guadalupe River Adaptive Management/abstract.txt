Abstract:
The Adaptive Management Team (AMT) makes recommendations to Santa Clara Valley Water District based on the annual mitigation monitoring report prepared for the Guadalupe River (Downtown) and Guadalupe Creek Restoration Projects.  If Santa Clara Valley Water District agrees with particular recommendations, projects to ensure that habitat (e.g., fisheries, riparian vegetation, SRA vegetation, etc.) is performing as intended would be undertaken by Santa Clara Valley Water District.  The types of projects (if needed) will vary, but focus on any emerging habitat, water quality and erosion/sedimentation issues.
